# Friword-finder

A (now written in Java) CLI word finder for word games. I'm not going to be as active with this project as my other ones.

You need a dictonary .txt file with a word per line at location assets/words.txt in the folder with the binary for the code to work.
The dictionary i use for testing can be found here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words, and a modified version is also included in this repo.
